- There were 94 total Vine reviews, and 40,471 total non-Vine reivews
- 48 Vine reviews were 5 stars, and 15,663 non-Vine reviews were 5 stars
- 51.06% of Vine reviews were 5 stars, and 38.7% of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars

## Summary
It is possible a positivity bias exists in the Vine reivew program - since consumers were paid to write the reviews, there may have been a higher incentive to give a 5 star review. This could explain why the percentage of 5 star Vine reviews is much higher than non-Vine reviews. Another analysis that could be done is determining the percentage of Vine and non-Vine reviews that were 3 stars or below. This would confirm if there was a positivity bias in the Vine reviews compared to the non-Vine reviews because if consumers were being honest either way, then the percentages would be more similar.
